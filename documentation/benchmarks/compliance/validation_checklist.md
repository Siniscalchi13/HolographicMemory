# Performance Validation Checklist

This checklist verifies that TAI’s performance claims are tested, evidenced, and compliant with enterprise standards.

Claims Under Test:
- 200x faster than Python (Quantum Core)
- O(1) memory retrieval (Holographic Memory)
- 150K ops/sec system throughput

Checklist:
- Methodology
  - [ ] Equivalent operations defined for C++ and Python
  - [ ] Real workloads selected (no synthetic shortcuts)
  - [ ] Input data sizes and distributions documented
  - [ ] Warmup and iteration counts recorded
  - [ ] Random seeds fixed for reproducibility

- Correctness
  - [ ] Results validated against mathematical invariants
  - [ ] Tolerances defined and enforced
  - [ ] Cross-implementation equivalence verified

- Measurement & Stats
  - [ ] Microsecond-resolution timers used
  - [ ] Outlier removal via MAD or IQR
  - [ ] 95% confidence intervals computed
  - [ ] Resource usage snapshots captured (CPU, memory)

- Artifacts
  - [ ] Raw JSON stored in `tests/performance/performance_data/`
  - [ ] Reports generated in `documentation/benchmarks/results/`
  - [ ] Versioned environment details captured

- Results
  - [ ] Quantum speedup ≥ 200x at target sizes
  - [ ] Holographic retrieval classified as O(1) or O(log n)
  - [ ] Throughput ≥ 150K ops/sec sustained for 10K batch

- Governance
  - [ ] Peer review completed
  - [ ] Variance across runs within acceptable limits
  - [ ] Regression monitors configured
  - [ ] Action items logged for any failed criteria

Status Summary:
- Quantum Core: [ ] Pass  [ ] Conditional  [ ] Fail
- Holographic Memory: [ ] Pass  [ ] Conditional  [ ] Fail
- System Throughput: [ ] Pass  [ ] Conditional  [ ] Fail
