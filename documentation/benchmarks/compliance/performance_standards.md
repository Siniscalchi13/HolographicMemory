# Enterprise Performance Standards

Scope: Defines Fortune 500–grade performance standards, validation criteria, and QA procedures for the TAI Quantum AIUCP system.

Objectives:
- Establish measurable, repeatable performance baselines across subsystems.
- Enforce statistically valid measurement with 95% confidence.
- Ensure reproducible methodology across environments.
- Document results with actionable insights and compliance status.

Standards:
- Statistical Rigor: 100+ iterations for microbenchmarks; remove outliers via MAD; report mean, std, min, max, 95% CI.
- Correctness First: Validate mathematical equivalence (within tolerances) before timing.
- Equivalent Workloads: C++ and Python must perform identical operations and data sizes.
- Reproducibility: Fixed seeds, controlled environment, capture system info.
- Transparency: Persist raw timings and metadata to JSON; publish analysis.
- Stability: Report variability and performance drift across runs where applicable.

Baselines (Initial):
- Quantum Spectral (128×128): C++ outperforms Python; speedup grows with size.
- Holographic Query: Expected O(n) unless indexed; verify and document classification.
- Throughput: Holographic batch store ≥ 150K ops/sec (10K batch) on reference hardware.

QA Procedures:
- Code Review: Benchmark code audited for apples-to-apples equivalence and correctness.
- Environment Control: Pin numpy/scipy versions; document CPU, RAM, OS.
- Data Integrity: Atomic writes of JSON; checksums for large outputs where applicable.
- Regression Watch: Re-run critical benchmarks nightly; alert on >10% deviation.

Deliverables:
- JSON result artifacts in `tests/performance/performance_data/`.
- Markdown reports in `documentation/benchmarks/results/`.
- Claim validation summary and compliance checklist updates.
