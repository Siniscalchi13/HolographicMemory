# Holographic Field Capacity Theorem (Engineering Form)

## Theorem

For a holographic field with M complex voxels storing N unit‑norm patterns via linear superposition, the Signal‑to‑Noise Ratio (SNR) at retrieval satisfies approximately:

SNR(N, M) ≈ sqrt(M / N)

To guarantee a target SNR ≥ S, the maximum load is:

N_max ≈ M / S²

## Sketch of Derivation

1. Let patterns {v_i} be near‑orthogonal unit‑norm codes in C^M. The superposed field is ψ = Σ_i v_i.
2. Query with v_k; the matched filter response is s = ⟨v_k, ψ⟩ = 1 + Σ_{i≠k} ⟨v_k, v_i⟩.
3. For random near‑orthogonal codes, cross terms have zero mean and variance ≈ 1/M; summing N−1 terms yields noise variance σ² ≈ (N−1)/M.
4. SNR ≈ 1 / σ ≈ sqrt(M / (N−1)) ≈ sqrt(M / N) for large N.
5. For SNR ≥ S: sqrt(M / N) ≥ S ⇒ N ≤ M / S².

## Practical Guidance

- Comfortable load: N ≤ 0.1 M (low error rates with simple thresholds)
- Production load: N ≈ M / 9 (S ≈ 3)
- High load: N ≈ M / 4 (S ≈ 2; increased error)

## Mitigations

- Multi‑field partitioning (topic clusters): reduce N/M per field
- Redundant encodings (Fourier/Hadamard/Wavelet) with voting
- Active forgetting/reinforcement to stabilize SNR
- HRR‑style binding/unbinding for identity without per‑item vectors
