# Mathematical Framework for 7‑Layer Holographic Memory

Version: 1.0

Parent: TAI Calculus (E ∘ P ∘ T ∘ I ∘ L ∘ W ∘ R ∘ D_t)

## 0. Overview

We formalize a 7‑layer holographic memory architecture with a dedicated Vault (security) layer:

1) Identity, 2) Knowledge, 3) Experience, 4) Preference, 5) Context, 6) Wisdom, 7) Vault.

Storage and retrieval follow the TAI operator chain: an encoder E produces layer‑specific representations, a projector/router P selects layers, temporal and identity/locality/wisdom operators (T, I, L, W) modulate routing and scoring, resonance R computes similarity, and D_t handles decay/update.

## 1. Hilbert Space Decomposition

Let H be a complex Hilbert space decomposed as an orthogonal direct sum of layer subspaces:

H = ⊕_{k=1}^7 H_k,  with dim(H_k) = D_k,  and Σ_k D_k = M.

Let P_k: H → H_k be the orthogonal projector (P_k P_l = 0 for k≠l; Σ_k P_k = I). Each item x has layer embeddings φ_k(x) ∈ H_k (possibly sparse) produced by E.

The field state is ψ = Σ_k ψ_k with ψ_k ∈ H_k, updated by superposition:

ψ_k ← ψ_k + φ_k(x) (plus optional normalization/decay under D_t).

## 2. Capacity and SNR Model

Assume near‑orthogonal, unit‑norm codes in each H_k. If layer k stores N_k items, the matched‑filter SNR at retrieval obeys the engineering rule of thumb:

SNR_k ≈ sqrt(D_k / N_k).

This follows from random code cross‑term variance ≈ (N_k − 1)/D_k. See Capacity Theorem (engineering form) for derivation.

## 3. Optimal Dimension Allocation

We allocate the total budget M across layers to maximize a weighted advantage (importance weights α_k ≥ 0):

Maximize  A = Σ_k α_k · SNR_k = Σ_k α_k · sqrt(D_k / N_k)  subject to  Σ_k D_k ≤ M,  D_k ≥ 0.

### Theorem 1.1 (Optimal D_k)

Given loads N_k > 0 and weights α_k ≥ 0, an optimal allocation is

D_k* = M · (α_k² / N_k) / (Σ_j α_j² / N_j).

Proof (Lagrangian). Consider L(D,λ) = Σ_k α_k sqrt(D_k/N_k) − λ(Σ_k D_k − M). ∂L/∂D_k = α_k (1/(2 sqrt(N_k D_k))) − λ = 0 ⇒ D_k ∝ α_k²/N_k. Normalizing by Σ_k D_k = M gives the stated formula. □

### Floors from SNR Targets

If layer k must satisfy SNR_k ≥ S_k, then D_k ≥ S_k² N_k. Feasibility requires Σ_k S_k² N_k ≤ M. Practical allocation uses Theorem 1.1 and clamps D_k to floors; rebalance periodically as N_k and α_k drift.

## 4. Security Layer (Vault) Privacy

The Vault layer stores sensitive content (passwords, keys, tokens). Policy: (i) never persist coefficients/patterns in artifacts; (ii) use a random (non‑content) identifier; (iii) reconstruct only via an encrypted 3D backend.

### Theorem 2.1 (Information‑Theoretic Privacy)

Let S be the secret and P_vault the persisted artifact defined by P_vault = (magic, flags, nonce, size, …) where nonce is an independent random variable, and no function of S appears in P_vault. Then H(S | P_vault) = H(S) and I(S; P_vault) = 0.

Proof. By construction P_vault ⟂ S (statistical independence). Hence p(s|p) = p(s), so H(S|P_vault) = H(S) and I(S;P_vault)=0. □

Computational Variant. If an identifier must be derived from S, use HMAC_K(S) with secret K. Under PRF security, membership/linkage inference is computationally infeasible; leakage is negligible for bounded adversaries.

## 5. Threshold Optimization (Small vs. Large Files)

Let c_micro be the micro‑header cost (≈ constant), c_v4(s) the sparse v4 cost for size s, c_microK8 an optional micro+coeffs cost.

### Theorem 3.1 (Crossover Threshold)

An optimal size threshold τ* minimizing expected storage under a distribution of sizes selects micro if s ≤ τ* and v4 if s > τ*, where τ* solves c_v4(τ*) = c_micro (or c_v4(τ*) = min{c_micro, c_microK8}).

Proof. The expected cost C(τ) = c_micro·F(τ) + E[c_v4(S)·1_{S>τ}] is minimized when the marginal costs equalize at the boundary; since both terms are monotone in τ, τ* occurs at equality of costs. □

Guarantee. Choosing micro for s ≤ τ* ensures no expansion for small files by construction; microK8 provides limited semantics under a tight bound.

## 6. Multi‑Layer Interference and Separation

If H = ⊕_k H_k and P_k are orthogonal projectors, then cross‑layer interference vanishes: ⟨u, v⟩ = 0 for u∈H_k, v∈H_l, k≠l. Retrieval score decomposes as s(q) = Σ_k w_k ⟨φ_k(q), ψ_k⟩.

Non‑ideal Bound. If mutual coherence μ_kl = max_{i,j} |⟨b_i^k, b_j^l⟩| ≤ μ < 1 across chosen bases, the noise variance contributed from layer l into k scales as Var_noise(k←l) ≲ (N_l/D_k)·μ². Design H_k to be (near) orthogonal and keep N_l/D_k modest.

## 7. Compression and Small‑File Guarantees

Sparse v4 size ≈ header + Σ_used_layers (K · coeff_bytes + metadata). With K=32 and 3–4 B/coeff, a single layer is ≈ 100–150 B; two layers ≈ 200–300 B. Micro header is ≈ 16 B. The policy “micro for s ≤ τ*” eliminates small‑file expansion and preserves large‑file compression.

## 8. Operator Chain (TAI Calculus)

E: layer encoders; P: router projectors/weights; T: temporal decay/boost; I: identity gating; L: location boosts; W: wisdom promotion; R: resonance; D_t: decay/update. Invariants: identity coherence (no cross‑user leakage), temporal correctness, locality gating, wisdom precedence, vault privacy.
