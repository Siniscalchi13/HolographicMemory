# Path to 100% Nobel-Ready

Current readiness: 85%

This roadmap outlines the concrete steps to reach 100% Nobel‐ready status across mathematics, documentation, implementation, and scientific impact.

## 1. Mathematical Foundations (9/10 → 10/10)

Remaining 10%
- Complete Coq formal verification of all theorems
- Publish peer‐reviewed papers in top venues (Nature, Science, NeurIPS)
- Establish information‐theoretic limits with rigorous proofs
- Demonstrate quantum advantage without quantum hardware

Action Plan
```bash
cd documentation/proofs/coq/
# Finish all .v files with complete verification
# Publish in academic venues
```

## 2. Documentation (8/10 → 10/10)

Remaining 20%
- Academic publications in top‐tier venues
- Conference presentations and live demos
- Industry case studies and real‑world deployments
- Academic citations and recognition

Action Plan
- Submit papers to Nature/Science/NeurIPS
- Present at major conferences (ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR)
- Document industry partnerships and deployments

## 3. Code Implementation (9/10 → 10/10)

Remaining 10%
- Cross‑platform GPU parity (CUDA/ROCm implementations)
- Device‐resident field buffers for production accuracy
- Multi‑GPU cluster support for distributed systems

Action Plan
```bash
# Implement CUDA kernels
cd holographic-fs/native/holographic/cuda/

# Implement ROCm kernels
cd holographic-fs/native/holographic/rocm/

# Add distributed GPU support
```

## 4. Scientific Rigor (7/10 → 10/10)

Remaining 30%
- Academic recognition through peer review
- Industry adoption and real‑world validation
- Theoretical innovation beyond standard FFT
- Paradigm‑shifting contributions to computing

Action Plan
- Complete academic publication pipeline
- Establish industry partnerships
- Develop novel algorithms beyond current implementation
- Demonstrate fundamental breakthrough in computing
