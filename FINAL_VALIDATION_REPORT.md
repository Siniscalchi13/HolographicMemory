# GPU Performance Validation Report

## Executive Summary
- **Target**: 200,000+ ops/sec at 1024-dimension
- **Date**: $(date)
- **Status**: [PENDING EXECUTION]

## Test Results

### 1. Build Validation
- [x] CMake build attempted (FFTW target missing; GPU module prebuilt)
- [x] Module loads without errors
- [x] GPU availability confirmed

### 2. Performance Validation
- [x] Maximum end-to-end performance (critical test): 49,149 ops/sec (50k batch)
- [x] Device-side metrics: 451,267 ops/sec (cached MPSGraph path)
- [ ] Target met (200K+ end-to-end): NO

### 3. Enterprise Benchmark
- [x] Ultra-optimized path P50: 50,874 ops/sec
- [x] Ultra-optimized path P95: 52,341 ops/sec

### 4. Accuracy Validation
- [ ] FFT accuracy: FAIL (as implemented compares magnitude vs cosine projection)
- Maximum difference: 1.64e+00
- CPU comparison: FAIL

## Final Assessment
- [ ] Performance meets 200K+ ops/sec end-to-end target
- [ ] Ready for production
- [x] Additional optimization needed

## Notes
- Device-side ops exceed 200k using cached MPSGraph; end-to-end remains ~50k due to Python orchestration and data marshaling.
- Accuracy test compared magnitude(FFT) to cosine projection; these are not equivalent. We should compare to a CPU FFT magnitude pipeline for apples-to-apples.
- CMake build of CPU modules failed due to missing FFTW target; GPU pybind module built and used successfully.
