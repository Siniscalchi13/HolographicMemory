# Vault Security Service

Purpose: Enforce Vault layer policy (secret detection, random IDs, access control hooks) per
documentation/specifications/VAULT_SECURITY_SPECIFICATION.md.

APIs (internal):
- SecurityGuard.detect_secrets(content: bytes) -> bool
- SecurityGuard.generate_vault_id() -> str  (random/opaque identifier)

Storage operations are handled by the 3D backend; this service provides policy/routing signals.
